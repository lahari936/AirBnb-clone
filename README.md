Now that you have a README.md file, you can include it when sharing your project on GitHub. To share this project on GitHub:

Create a new repository at https://github.com/lahari936
Download your project as a ZIP file from Replit (using the three dots menu in the Files panel)
Unzip the file on your local computer
Initialize a git repository in the unzipped folder and push it to GitHub:
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: AirBnb clone project"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/lahari936/[your-repo-name].git
git push -u origin main
Or you can use Replit's built-in GitHub integration if available in your Replit interface.

Is there anything specific about the README that you'd like me to change or expand upon?
